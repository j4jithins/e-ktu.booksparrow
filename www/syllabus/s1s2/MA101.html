    In this course the students are introduced to some basic tools in Mathematics which are useful in
modelling and analysing physical phenomena involving continuous changes of variables or
parameters. The differential and integral calculus of functions of one or more variables and of
vector functions taught in this course have applications across all branches of engineering. This
course will also provide basic training in plotting and visualising graphs of functions and
intuitively understanding their properties using appropriate software packages.
