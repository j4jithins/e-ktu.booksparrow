            <b> Course Objectives</b><br>







            This course introduces basic ideas of differential equations, both ordinary and partial, which are
            widely used in the modelling and analysis of a wide range of physical phenomena and has got
            applications across all branches of engineering. The course also introduces Fourier series which is
            used by engineers to represent and analyse periodic functions in terms of their frequency
            components







            <br><br><b>Expected Outcome</b><br>


            At the end of the course students will have acquired basic knowledge of differential equations and
            methods of solving them and their use in analysing typical mechanical or electrical systems.
            The included set of assignments will familiarise the students with the use of software packages for
            analysing systems modelled by differential equations.
