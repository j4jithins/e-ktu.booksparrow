        Most of the engineering disciplines are rooted in Physics. In fact a good engineer is more or less an
applied physicist. This course is designed to provide a bridge to the world of technology from the
basics of science and to equip the students with skills in scientiﬁc inquiry, problem solving, and
laboratory techniques.
