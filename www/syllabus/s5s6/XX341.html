       <li>To understand the engineering aspects of design with reference to simple products</li>
       <li>To foster innovation in design of products, processes or systems</li>
       <li>To develop design that add value to products and solve technical problems  </li>
         
         
         
         
       

         
         
         
         
       
         
         
                
         
        
               
        <br><br><b>Course Plan</b>
        <p>
            
        <b>Study:</b>Take minimum three simple products, processes or techniques in the area of specialisation, study, analyse and present them. The analysis shall be focused on functionality, strength, material, manufacture/construction, quality, reliability, aesthetics, ergonomics, safety, maintenance, handling, sustainability, cost etc. whichever are applicable. Each student in the group has to present individually; choosing different products, processes or techniques.<br>
<b>Design:</b> The project team shall identify an innovative product, process or technology and proceed with detailed design. At the end, the team has to document it properly and present and defend it.
The design is expected to concentrate on functionality, design for strength is not expected.<br>
<b>Note</b> : The one hour/week allotted for tutorial shall be used for discussions and presentations. The project team (not exceeding four) can be students from different branches, if the design problem is multidisciplinary.
