         <br> The question paper consists of three parts. Part A covers modules I and II, Part B covers modules III and IV and Part C covers modules V and VI. Each part has three questions. Each question can have a maximum of four subparts. Among the three questions one will be a compulsory question covering both the modules and the remaining two questions will be as one question from each module, of which one is to be answered. Mark pattern is according to the syllabus with maximum 60 % for theory, derivation, proof and 40% for logical/numerical problems.<br>
