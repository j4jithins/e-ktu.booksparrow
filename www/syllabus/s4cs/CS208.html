<b> Course Objectives</b><br>
    <ol>
<li>To impart the basic understanding of the theory and applications of database management systems.
<li>To give basic level understanding of internals of database systems.
<li>To expose to some of the recent trends in databases.
     </ol>
    <br><div class="div3"></div><br>
    
<b> Expected outcome</b><br>
    <ol>
Students will be able to:
<li> define, explain and illustrate the fundamental concepts of databases.
