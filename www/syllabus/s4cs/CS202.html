Fundamental building blocks and functional units of a computer. Execution phases of an instruction. Arithmetic Algorithms. Design of the processing unit – how arithmetic and logic operations are performed. Design of the control unit – hardwired and microprogrammed control. I/O organisation – interrupts, DMA, different interface standards. Memory Subsystem – different types.
