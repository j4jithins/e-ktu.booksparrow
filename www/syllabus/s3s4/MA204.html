     1. To introduces the modern theory of probability and its applications to modelling and analysis and processing          of random processes and signals.
     2. To learn most of the important models of discrete and continuous probability distributions and widely used          models of random processes such as Poisson processes and Markov chains.
     3. To understand some basic numerical methods for interpolation and integration and also for finding roots of              equations and solutions of ODEs.

              <li> At the end of the course students would have become familiar with quantifying and analysing random phenomena using various models of probability distributions and random processes. They would also have learned the concepts of autocorrelation and power spectral density which are useful in the analysis of random signals. Some of the fundamental numerical methods learned in the course would help them to solve a variety of mathematical problems by the use of computers when analytical methods fail or are difficult. </li>
