       The question paper shall consist of three parts. Part A covers I and II module, Part B covers III and IV module, Part C covers V and VI module. Each part has three questions, which may have maximum four subdivisions. Among the three questions, one will be a compulsory question covering both modules and the remaining from each module, of which one to be answered. Mark patterns are as per the syllabus with 30 % for theory and 70% for logical/numerical problems, derivation and proof.
